<h1>Seeker</h1>
Seeker is a path-finding software using the A* algorithm that allows you to find a way between two points as quickly as possible. All this with a graphical interface allowing to place or generate random obstacles or to configure several parameters such as the diagonal movement, the size of the grid and the speed of travel. 

More information about A* can be found here:
