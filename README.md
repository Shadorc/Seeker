# Seeker
Seeker is a simple implementation of the path-findind algorithm named A* with a graphical interface.  
A* allows you to find a path between two points as quickly as possible.  
The graphical interface provides:
- A way to generate random obstacles 
- Activation of diagonal movements
- Configuration of the grid's size
- Configuration of the time between actions (travel speed) 

More information about A* can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
